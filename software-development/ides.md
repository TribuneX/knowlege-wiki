# IDEs

## IntelliJ

I am using IntelliJ as my primary IDE for my daily coding tasks in Java as well as for python developement. IntelliJ with its python plugin has almost the same features as [Pycharm](https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/PYH/PyCharm+vs.+IntelliJ+IDEA+Python+plugin+FAQ).

### IntelliJ Plugins

* [Gitlab Quick Merge Requests](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/11149-gitlab-quick-merge-request) - Create merge requests from within IntelliJ
