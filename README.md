# Introduction

## Knowledge Wiki

This is a wiki containing most of the information I learned so far. This wiki is rendered as a [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com).

## Why

I figured out, that my brain stores information better if I wright things down. In the writing process I need to order and structure information, which makes it easier to remember. This is especially true if I wright text for the public space. Therefore, combining these two things together should further improve the way I can remember things. I follow this one sentence, which I learned from my german class teacher back in school: "Wissen hei√üt wissen, wo es geschrieben steht." by [Albert Einstein](https://www.gutzitiert.de/zitat_autor_albert_einstein_thema_wissen_zitat_3425.html)

### History

I started personal wikis multiple times. Some years back, I started hosting a [DokuWiki](https://www.dokuwiki.org/dokuwiki). A next iteration was based on [Notion](https://www.notion.so/), where I started to document things which came to my mind frequently. In 2019 I started a new approach to keep notes in a wiki style in Apple notes. The main driver was the ability to add and edit information from any device \(mobile, desktop, tablet\). However, I often miss the ability to properly link information together. I love the idea of Hyperlinks in the web. Therefore, I also want to link information together in my personal wiki.

I started this wiki back in 2020 after discovering the impressive wiki of [Nikita Voloboev](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz). It insprired me to the same with my own knowlege. Collect it, structure it and share it with everyone \(including myself\) who is interested.
